# Overtime Tracking App

## Overview
### Purpose
Small project to help learn Python and Django. This task was being done using a spreadsheet within our company and I thought it was a fun problem to solve using Django

## Features
### Teams
Allowing for a dedicated manager means tracking overtime for employees

### Penalty Types
Set up different penalty types with different reasons to allow for separation between payout types. 
For example, an on-call incident might accrue Paid overtime, whereas any time spent performing a change within an agreed change window may accrue Time off in Lieu (TOIL).

### Time tracking
Users can add a start time and a duration that they spent doing a task. The data can then be viewed by the user or a team manager.
